Hi, I'm Dessy.
=======
 
I'm a software developer in Toronto, and the CTO and Co-Founder of 
[Greengage](http://greengagemobile.com).
I studied engineering at Queenâ€™s, 
and fell in love with software development shortly after. 
When I'm not busy coding, you can find me at local 
Toronto tech events. I'm a vegetarian, and I love to cook.
