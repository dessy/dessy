Hi, I'm Dessy.
=======
 
I'm a software developer in Toronto, and the CTO and co-founder of 
<a href="http://greengagemobile.com" target="_blank">Greengage</a>. 
I spend most of my time building Greengage and dreaming up big ideas 
for the future with the team.

I'm also a developer advocate at 
<a href="http://www.theworkinggroup.ca/" target="_blank">The Working Group</a>, 
an awesome web and mobile development shop in Toronto. 

If you're a developer, and you love pizza, beer, nerds, and learning, 
you should come out to one of the 
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nerdlearn" target="_blank">#nerdlearn</a>
panels I host at The Working Group. 
We choose a different topic each time, and find three or four inspiring developers 
in the community to discuss it. Sometimes we hold demo days instead, to keep things fresh.
Our past events have included:

<a href="http://blog.twg.ca/2012/01/nerdlearn-the-future-of-javascript/" target="_blank">The Future of JavaScript</a>
<br />
<a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/77970" target="_blank">Demo Day</a>
<br />
<a href="http://blog.twg.ca/2011/08/nerdlearn-2-0-the-future-of-mobile-dev/" target="_blank">The Future of Mobile Dev</a>
