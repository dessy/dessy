On March 31st, I taught my second
<a href="http://ladieslearningcode.com/" target="_blank">Ladies Learning Code</a>
Intro to Ruby workshop. The incredible experience of teaching a Ladies Learning Code workshop 
warrants a separate blog post, so I'll stick to my original intentions for this one. 

The workshop is geared toward complete beginners to software development, and assumes no prior knowledge 
of anything programming-related. I think of it not as an intro to Ruby, but an intro to programming, 
with Ruby as the vehicle to get the audience familiar with basic concepts.

During the workshop, I had several questions along the lines of "Where do I go from here?". In a day 
full of incredible highs, the peak of the mountain was when I was asked that very question. 
I know that Ladies Learning Code has hit on something amazing when a roomful of people in the middle of 
a feast are asking for more food. So, in response to this and other similar questions, I've compiled a list of 
resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    Parts of the workshop, in particular the very beginning, were inspired by the book 
    <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" target="_blank">Learn to Program</a> by Chris Pine. 
    I highly recommend this book for complete beginners to programming. It walks you through many of 
    the foundational concepts, and explains everything very clearly.

    Another great resource, which also assumes absolutely no prior programming experience, is 
    <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a>. 
    You can get the PDF for $2.99, or read the HTML version for free. In the spirit of giving back to 
    the community, I would encourage you to purchase a copy of the book rather than relying solely on the  
    free version. (Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/GroceryBagHead" target="_blank">Oleg</a> for suggesting this resource.)

    If you're up for some humour alongside your dose of Ruby education, check out 
    <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/" target="_blank">_why's (Poignant Guide) to Ruby</a>. 
    It's super quirky, entertaining, and fun.

    You can view the slides I prepared for the workshop <a href="/ladies-learning-ruby" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    They're also up on <a href="https://github.com/dessy/ladieslearningcode-ruby" target="_blank">github</a>, along with the 
    puzzles, assignments, and worksheets used.

</ul>

If you've plowed through this list and are looking for more, then you're amazing! Get in touch with me and 
I'll absolutely dig up more for you, and append to this post.
